To run DyLin on the microbenchmark you only need `python` installed.
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-tests.txt
pytest tests
```
The output should show all tests passing (might have a few warnings about deprecation).

To run DyLin on GitHub projects you need `docker` and `git`. The docker container installs all the required packages and downloads the repositories as well.

To run DyLin on Kaggle submissions you need `docker` and a Kaggle API key placed in `kaggle.json` file in the root directory with the following format:
```json
{"username": "your username", "key": "your API key"}
```
The docker container installs all the required packages and also downloads the competition data, environments, and submissions.
